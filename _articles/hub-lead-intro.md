# Hub Participation in the GLobal Sprint

In 2017, we're building out the global sprint with all the Hubs to create a truly diverse and far reaching event, bringing together contributors from all corners of the network-- educators, devs, activists and designers-- to collaborate on code, curriculum, and tools.

Check out the [community-facing Global Sprint Site]() here.

When your Hub participates in the Global sprint, you:

* Energize community projects and push them forward
* Strengthen connections within your community and create new connections across Mozilla
* Support those from your community taking part in Open Leadership training, which culminates in leading Global Sprint projects
* Hear voices and see faces from around Mozilla’s diverse global community
* Spark interest and prepare projects and participants for further collaboration in your own hubs and across the network
* Supercharge your MozFest presence-- successful Sprint project leads make well-prepared Mozfest session presenters and active, engaged participants

###How can my Hub and my communities participate?
Anyone from across the network can join the Global sprint as a Project Lead, a Site Host, a Participant/Contributor, or a combination of roles. On the site we have instructions and info for each role. 

* Project Leads bring their projects to the Sprint and facilitate contributions 
* Site Hosts coordinate a local work space
* Participants pitch in their varied amaizng skills and energy to push Sprint projects forward

###What can Hub Leads and staff do to help ensure a successful Sprint?

* **Recruit Sprint projects**  Direct potential leads to Global Sprint site and submission form. More about wrangling Projects & Project Leads here.
* **Recruit Site Hosts** Aim to secure 5 sites. Partner groups, institutions or orgs make great site hosts. More about wrangling Sites here. 
* **Recruit Participants** Get the word out! Blog, tweet, and post on your preferred social media sites about the Sprint! Highlight it in your community calls and other comms! More about comms here.
* **Distribute Swag** Send out Global Sprint Swag (stickers, posters, etc) to site hosts and/or participants who request it.
* **Gather Data about the Sprint** Help us collect metrics and assess the Sprint. Your community's participation metrics can be part of your Hub's year-end reporting, and help us all see how we are growing the Network. More about metrics and Assessment here. 

###What kind of online tools and platforms will be in use for/at the Sprint?
* The Network-facing Global Sprint site
