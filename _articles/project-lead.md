**If you have your own open project, whether it's brand new or well-established, you can be a Project Lead at the Sprint! By bringing your project to the Global Sprint, you invite contribution (which may be code, content, design, editing, writing, testing, advice, etc) from participants from across Mozilla's amazing Network.**  

By registering for the Sprint, Project Leads understand and agree that any data they provide will be handled according to [Mozilla's Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/).

### Register your Project in 4 easy steps!

* **COMPLETE** this [project submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/0enj1vARqdBA2FHF3)
* **LOOK** for an email from us, with a point of contact and a link to a GitHub issue
* **FILL OUT/COMPLETE** the Git Hub issue.

### The Basics

In 2017 we're inviting a wide range of open projects, from security/privacy tools to scientific software to web literacy curriculum to community events-- nearly anything that supports or builds the open web.  Any project entered in the sprint should:

* have a designated **project lead** who can lead the work before and during the sprint
* allow and **welcome contributions** by Sprint participants
* support the **open web and a healthy internet.**

To REGISTER your project for the sprint, you will need, at minimum:

* a GitHub account
* a GitHub Repository to host your project information.
* a License indicating how users can reuse, remix and share your open project

[This is easy to do! Information about opening a GitHub account and creating a repository and choosing a license are here](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-requirements/). You'll also find information about a few extra steps you can do to get your project FEATURED on Network Pulse and here on the Global Sprint site, where potential contributors will see them first. **In past Sprints, FEATURED projects had nearly 5 times as many contributions and active contributors as projects that were simply registered without good documentation.** (Registered projects are listed among our all the projects in our GitHub issue tracker for the Sprint).

### The Project Lead Role
The Project Lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint!  All Project Leads should have a good understanding of basic open practices. **We're strongly recommending that all Global Sprint Project Leads take ["Open Leadership 101"](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) a very short (1-hour) online course covering these concepts.**

Project leads should:

* document and prepare their projects **in advance** of the Sprint
* **be available from 9-5 in their local time on the days of the Sprint** to coordinate project work, answer questions, and approve contributions and pull requests
* be a **welcoming, enthusiastic, and patient** project leader

### Frequently Asked Questions (for Project Leads)

**Q: How can I get contributors to work on my project at the Sprint?**

A: There are four great ways to attract contributors to your project.
1. Be sure your project is well documented and all documentation is beginner-friendly. Complete the checklist for FEATURED projects to be highlighted on [Network Pulse](https://mozilla.github.io/network-pulse/) and the [Global Sprint Page Projects Page](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/). 
2. Come up with lots of small- to medium- tasks that are appropriate and satisfying for newcomers to do. These are sometimes called "good first bugs" and you'll document them under the Issues tab in your project where contributors can find them and easily jump in to help out. 
3. If you know you need specific skills on your project, ask for them! Make your needs clear in your README file for the project
4. GET THE WORD OUT! This is perhaps most important. We'll be promoting the Sprint across our Network, and we invite you to do the same. Tweet, post, and share across your own personal and professional networks. 

**Q: I can't be at the Sprint the whole time, but someone else on the project can fill in for me. Is this OK?**

A: First, please know that we ONLY expect that Project Leads to be available from 9 to 5 in their timezone on June 1st and 2nd-- **we don't expect you to stay up all night!** And we know that the Sprint takes place during the week during work hours. so your moment to moment availability may be limited. What's most important is that, during the Sprint, someone knowledgeable about the project is checking in regularly with participants to assign work, answer questions, review and approve contributions, and generally be welcoming and encouraging.
